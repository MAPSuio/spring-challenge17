# IP Freely

<img src="image.jpg" align="right" width="250px" style="margin: 10px;">

The Internet Protocol defines IPv4 addresses to be 32-bits.

They are usually written in [human-readable notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing), but can also be written as plain integers. For example:
The IP address 171.173.222.237 corresponds to the unsigned 32-bit
decimal integer 2880298733.

Below is a list of reserved IP address ranges. What is the sum of all
non-reserved IP addresses as a decimal integer?
