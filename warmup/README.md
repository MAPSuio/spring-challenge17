Alice and Bob communicate using their super awesome, totally impossible to crack code, and Eve wants to figure out what they are talking about. In a shocking twist, Alice and Bob figure out that Eve is trying to crack their code. In an attempt to fool Eve, they leave a message encoded with a much simpler code for her to find. The message is encoded by following each vowel with an "r" and the vowel itself, and following each consonant with an "o" and the consonant itself. Spaces are left unchanged. For example, `hello world` will be changed to `hoherelolloloro woworororloldod`.

If Alice and Bob leave the encoded message `wowerelolcocoromomere totoro tothohere soshohorowow` for Eve, what was the original message?
