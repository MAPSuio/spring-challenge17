# Pretty palindromes

Anna loves her name, and what she loves most about her name is that it
is the same backwards and forwards; it is a palindrome. One day when
she was out walking and trying to catch Eevee in Pok√©mon GO, she found
a memory stick. The memory stick contained [this](data.txt) text file
consisting of 10000 words and nothing more.

Anna needs your help to find which words palindromes in the file are
palindromes. However, she thinks that palindromes which contain only
one letter are ugly palindromes, so those should not count.

## Your task

Find the words in the file which are palindromes and contain at least
two different letters. Give your answer as `n s` where `n` is the
number of such palindromes and `s` is the longest palindrome in the
file.
