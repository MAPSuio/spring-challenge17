# Palindromes

Anna loves her name, and what she loves most about her name is that it is the same backwards and forwards; it is a palindrome. One day when she was out walking and trying to catch Eevee in Pok√©mon GO, she found a memory stick. The memory stick contained this text file consisting of 10000 words and nothing more.

Anna needs your help to find which words palindromes in the file are palindromes. However, she does not think that palindromes which contain only one letter are real palindromes, so those should not count.

####Your task
Find the words in the file which are palindromes and contain at least two different letters. Give your answer as `n s` where `n` is the number of such palindromes and `s` is the longest palindrome in the file.
