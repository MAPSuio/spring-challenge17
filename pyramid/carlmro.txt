We first consider the general case of a pyramid constructed only with 2x4s:


Find the arithmetic sequence describing the number of bricks
in a given floor. It is

floor_cost(n) = 2 + 2*(n-1)

The corresponding arithmetic series giving the total cost of a general
n-floored pyramid is then given by

pyramid_cost = n * (floor_cost(1) + floor_cost(n)) // 2

In our case, the inverse of this function becomes (using Wolfram Alpha)

(1/2) * (-1 +- sqrt(4*y + 1))

when plugging in y=number of 2x4s, we get 50005000 floors. Finally, we add
the top level (the 2x2) and get 50005001 floors.
