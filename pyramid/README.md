# Pyramid

Sigurd the avid Lego-builder is building a pyramid using the
following method:

1. He starts with a single 2x2 brick. ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1833533/spring_challenge_illus/step_one.png)
2. He adds two 2x4 bricks underneath the 2x2 brick. ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1833533/spring_challenge_illus/step_two.png)
3. He adds 2x4 bricks around the perimeter of the lowest layer of the pyramid ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1833533/spring_challenge_illus/step_three.png)

After step 3, the pyramid looks like this from below:

He then repeats step 3 as long as he has 2x4 bricks left.

Wanting to stimulate his problem-solving ability, Sigurds parents have
given him `1` 2x2 brick and `2500500075005000` 2x4 bricks.

After the three first steps, the pyramid is three floors tall. *How many
complete floors does the pyramid have after Sigurd has used up all his
Lego bricks?*
