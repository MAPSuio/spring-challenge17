# Nasty NASA

You have applied for the prestigious job as an astronaut for NASA. You will need to man a spacecraft, which is a terribly complex task. You will also need to deal with other astronauts on the spacecraft. Therefore NASA gives you this problem on the job interview, to see if you are up for the task:

In the cockpit of the spacecraft, there are `N` ordered switches that are initially all switched off. Now, an astronaut in your spacecraft has gone slightly mad from being isolated in space. First, he turns on every switch. And then he turns off every other switch. Call the action of turning _off_ a switch that is _on_, and turning _on_ a switch that is _off_, for **toggling** a switch. The astronaut now toggles every third, and then every fourth, and so on, continuing until he finally toggles every _Nth_ switch.

Suppose `N` is 100 million (10<sup>8</sup>). What is the sum of all switches that are switched off after the mad astronaut is done?
